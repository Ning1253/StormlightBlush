# StormlightBlush
A directory for counting the amount of blushes in the Stormlight Archive (currently books 1 to 3, since I haven't read book 4 yet and don't want spoilers)

## 1. Sentence 1643 of The Way of Kings: 

Dock registrar says that Jasnah hasn’t left yet. ”

“Ha!” the captain said, turning to Shallan.  “The hunt is over!”

“Bless the Heralds,” Shallan said softly. 

The captain smiled, flamboyant eyebrows looking like streaks of light coming from his eyes.  “It must be your beautiful face that brought us this favorable wind! The windspren themselves were entranced by you, Brightness Shallan, and led us here!”

Shallan blushed, considering a response that wasn’t particularly proper. 

### {Shallan} -> {Tozbek}
## 2. Sentence 1658 of The Way of Kings: 

She’d often fabricated silly versions of conversations to fill the mouths of people they could see, but not hear. 

That had established in her what her nurses had referred to as an “insolent streak. ” And the sailors were even more appreciative of a witty comment than her brothers had been. 

“Well,” Shallan said to the captain, blushing but still eager to speak, “I was just thinking this: You say that my beauty coaxed the winds to deliver us to Kharbranth with haste. 

### {Shallan} -> {Tozbek}
## 3. Sentence 1786 of The Way of Kings: 

“Afraid so.  But you can’t go someplace a second time until you been there a first time, I reckon.  Everyone has to stand out sometime, so you might as well do it in a pretty way like yourself!”

She’d had to get used to gentle flirtation from the sailors.  They were never too forward, and she suspected the captain’s wife had spoken to them sternly when she’d noticed how it made Shallan blush. 

### {Shallan} -> {Sailors}
## 4. Sentence 1858 of The Way of Kings: 

She kept the most valuable spheres she had in her safepouch, of course, which was buttoned to the inside of her left sleeve. 

She handed the three chips to Yalb, who cocked his head.  She nodded at the porter, blushing, realizing that she’d reflexively used Yalb like a master-servant intermediary. 

### {Shallan} -> {Yalb}
## 5. Sentence 2411 of The Way of Kings: 

I would be far from the best you’d heard, but I’d also be far from the worst.  I know most historical ballads by heart. ”

“Give me the refrain from ‘Lilting Adrene. ’”

“Here?”

“I’m not fond of repeating myself, child. ”

Shallan blushed, but began to sing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 6. Sentence 2429 of The Way of Kings: 

“I had reason to believe you wanted to be a scholar, not a purveyor of superstitious nonsense. ”

“I have kept a journal since I was a child,” Shallan continued, “in order to practice my writing skills. ”

“Congratulations,” Jasnah said.  “Should I need someone to write a treatise on their stuffed pony or give an account of an interesting pebble they discovered, I shall send for you.  Is there nothing you can offer that shows you have true skill?”

Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 7. Sentence 2456 of The Way of Kings: 

The longer I live, the more I come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind.  There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts. ”

Shallan blushed again. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 8. Sentence 3713 of The Way of Kings: 

Namely, that of being dead.  For three hundred years. ”

Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kabsal}
## 9. Sentence 4001 of The Way of Kings: 

He stood there on the busy roadway, lit from above by a lantern burning yellow-orange, hands on his hips, white Thaylen eyebrows drooping along the sides of his face, bare-chested under his open vest.  That was a posture no citizen, no matter how high ranked, had ever taken at her father’s mansion. 

“I did try to persuade her,” Shallan said, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Yalb}
## 10. Sentence 4142 of The Way of Kings: 

So nice of you to give a poignant object lesson to accompany your brilliant metaphor.  Do you treat all of your customers this way?”

“Brightness…I believe you stray into sarcasm. ”

“Funny.  I thought I’d run straight into it, screaming at the top of my lungs. ”

He blushed and stood. 

### {Bookshop Owner} -> {Shallan}
## 11. Sentence 4245 of The Way of Kings: 

I just figured he’d be trying to take you for as much as he could.  That’s why I asked around for who his biggest rival was and came back to help get him to be more reasonable. ”

“It was that obvious I’d let myself be swindled?” she asked with a blush, the two of them walking out of the side street. 

### {Shallan} -> {Yalb}
## 12. Sentence 4326 of The Way of Kings: 

“I honestly didn’t want to disturb you. ”

“I bribed the servants to tell me if you returned to the Veil,” Jasnah said idly, picking up one of Shallan’s tomes, reading the title.  “I didn’t want to be interrupted again. ”

“I—” Shallan looked down, blushing furiously. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 13. Sentence 4781 of The Way of Kings: 

“Son, you nearly cry each time someone is brought to us; you grind your teeth anxiously during even simple procedures.  What makes you think you could actually hurt someone?”

“I’ll get stronger. ”

“That’s foolishness.  Who’s put these ideas in your head? Why would you want to learn to hit other boys with a stick?”

“For honor, Father,” Kal said.  “Who tells stories about surgeons, for the Heralds’s sake!”

“The children of the men and women whose lives we save,” Lirin said evenly, meeting Kal’s gaze.  “That’s who tell stories of surgeons. ”

Kal blushed and shrank back, then finally returned to his scrubbing. 

### {Kal} -> {Lirin}
## 14. Sentence 6162 of The Way of Kings: 

“Earlier this morning, he told me he’d determined not to say anything around you. ”

“Wonderful!” Wit exclaimed.  “Then I can say whatever I wish, and he’ll not object?”

Renarin hesitated. 

Wit leaned in to Adolin.  “Have I told you about the night Prince Renarin and I had two days back, walking the streets of the warcamp? We came across these two sisters, you see, blue eyed and—”

“That’s a lie!” Renarin said, blushing. 

### {Renarin} -> {Wit}
## 15. Sentence 13226 of The Way of Kings: 

“Beats knives at dawn, I suppose. ”

“I guess that depends,” Kaladin said. 

“Upon what?” Teft asked. 

“On whether or not you’re a knife merchant.  Eh, Dunny?”

The other two glanced to the side, where Dunny had moved up close to listen.  The spindly youth jumped and blushed. 

### {Dunny} -> {Kaladin}
## 16. Sentence 13278 of The Way of Kings: 

This particular chasm didn’t seem to have much in the way of salvage this time.  “I had begun thinking you were all as tone deaf as my father’s old axehound.  Ha!”

Dunny blushed, but seemed to walk more confidently. 

### {Dunny} -> {Rock}
## 17. Sentence 14313 of The Way of Kings: 

Keep her at arm’s length, Uncle.  She bites. ’”

From the side, Navani sniffed, and Dalinar realized he hadn’t signaled that Navani was actually listening.  He blushed as Danlan continued speaking. 

### {Dalinar} -> {Navani}
## 18. Sentence 15400 of The Way of Kings: 

Jasnah walked past, wearing a sleek violet dress, followed by a parshman porter with a stack of books.  “I’ll try not to take it personally. ”

Shallan winced, then blushed furiously. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 19. Sentence 15480 of The Way of Kings: 

Consider.  You have trained yourself to do something very similar to what annoys you in the scholars: cleverness without thought behind it—intelligence, one might say, without a foundation of proper consideration. ” Jasnah turned a page.  “Errorgant, wouldn’t you say?”

Shallan blushed. 

### {Shalan} -> {Jasnah}
## 20. Sentence 15627 of The Way of Kings: 

“I’d be happy to draw your likeness. ”

He beamed as she stood, leaving her meal half eaten and gathering her things.  She glanced at Jasnah, but the older woman’s face was unreadable. 

“Would you prefer a simple portrait against a white background?” Shallan asked.  “Or would you prefer a broader perspective, including surroundings?”

“Perhaps,” Jasnah said pointedly, “you should wait until the meal is finished, Shallan?”

Shallan blushed, feeling a fool for her enthusiasm. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 21. Sentence 15756 of The Way of Kings: 

The king withdrew with his attendants, several parshmen entering to remove the table. 

“I’ve never known you to make a mistake in drawing,” Jasnah said, sitting back down at the desk.  “At least not one so horrible that you destroyed the paper. ”

Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 22. Sentence 17205 of The Way of Kings: 

If only Jasnah had been able to see the true beauty of our doctrine. ” He smiled, digging a thick book out of his bread basket.  “I really had hoped, originally, to be able to show her what I mean. ”

“I doubt she’d react well to that. ”

“Perhaps,” he said idly, hefting the tome.  “But to be the one who finally convinced her!”

“Brother Kabsal, that sounds almost like you’re seeking distinction. ”

He blushed, and she realized she’d said something that genuinely embarrassed him. 

### {Kabsal} -> {Shallan}
## 23. Sentence 18533 of The Way of Kings: 

He could do the same with her. 

Kal stood up and nodded to her.  She glanced at him, and blushed faintly, walking in with an old nurse in tow—a chaperone. 

### {Laral} -> {Kaladin}
## 24. Sentence 20155 of The Way of Kings: 

They’d eat the berries around the campfire and have a rather…interesting night. ”

“It’s a wonder—” Shallan began, then bit her lip. 

“What?” he prodded. 

She sighed.  “It’s a wonder they didn’t become known as birthberries, considering—” She blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kabsal}
## 25. Sentence 20157 of The Way of Kings: 

She sighed.  “It’s a wonder they didn’t become known as birthberries, considering—” She blushed. 

He laughed.  “That’s a good point!”

“Stormfather,” she said, blushing further. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kabsal}
## 26. Sentence 20192 of The Way of Kings: 

“Jam should not have lore or mythology.  It should be sweet, colorful, and delicious. ”

“Like young ladies, I presume. ”

“Brother Kabsal!” She blushed again. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kabsal}
## 27. Sentence 20197 of The Way of Kings: 

“That wasn’t at all appropriate. ”

“And yet you smile. ”

“I can’t help it,” she said.  “I’m sweet, colorful, and delicious. ”

“You have the colorful part right,” he said, obviously amused at her deep blush. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kabsal}
## 28. Sentence 20203 of The Way of Kings: 

She’d once told herself that he was interested in her only in order to protect her soul, but that was getting more and more difficult to believe.  He stopped by at least once a week. 

He chuckled at her embarrassment, but that only made her blush further. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kabsal}
## 29. Sentence 21584 of The Way of Kings: 

Or…well, she is demanding.  I just don’t mind as much as she thinks I do. ”

“Very well,” he said.  “But what were you doing down here, then?”

She bit her lip, causing him to laugh. 

“What?” she demanded, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kabsal}
## 30. Sentence 21808 of The Way of Kings: 

She walked down the dark hallway, Kabsal following with the lanterns.  Jasnah looked up appraisingly as Shallan entered their alcove, but did not ask why she’d taken so long.  Shallan found herself blushing as she gathered her drawing tools. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 31. Sentence 22346 of The Way of Kings: 

And I mean to. ”

“And how are you going to do that?” Kaladin asked, amused. 

“I came to this war to get myself a Shardblade,” Moash said.  “And I still mean to do it, somehow. ” He blushed, then turned away. 

### {Moash} -> {Kaladin}
## 32. Sentence 22752 of The Way of Kings: 

Her safehand was still exposed.  Sleek, with tan skin, the fingers long and delicate.  Kaladin found himself staring at it and blushing.

## 34. Sentence 23442 of The Way of Kings: 

“I am sorry, Shallan Davar.  In overworking you, I may have done the world a disservice and stolen from it one of the great scholars of the rising generation. ”

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 35. Sentence 23482 of The Way of Kings: 

All others—heretic, Vorin, Ysperist, or Maakian—are equally closed-minded. ” She took her hand from the book, moving as if to stand up.

Jasnah turned to her. 

“Kabsal,” Shallan said, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 36. Sentence 23530 of The Way of Kings:

“Thinking back, I really should have been able to hate her.  But she was just so nice.  Though she wasn’t very… well…”

### {Navani} -> {Dalinar}
## 38. Sentence 125 of Words of Radiance: 

It seemed obvious to her that Gavilar and Amaram had ducked out to find privacy for their discussion.  “This is the tiresome part of the feast, where the conversation grows louder but no smarter, and the company drunken. ”

“Many people consider that sort of thing enjoyable. ”

“Many people, unfortunately, are idiots. ”

Her father smiled.  “Is it terribly difficult for you?” he asked softly.  “Living with the rest of us, suffering our average wits and simple thoughts? Is it lonely to be so singular in your brilliance, Jasnah?”

She took it as the rebuke it was, and found herself blushing. 

### {Jasnah} -> {Gavilar}
## 39. Sentence 642 of Words of Radiance: 

Well, get to it. ” It was unlikely she’d be able to go through with this without the captain finding out anyway. 

Yalb grinned.  “What happened to you in Kharbranth? Your first trip with us, you were so timid, you looked like you’d faint at the mere thought of sailing away from your homeland!”

Shallan hesitated, then found herself blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Yalb}
## 40. Sentence 666 of Words of Radiance: 

You just won’t let yourself remember them. 

“What is this?” Tozbek asked as he came up, his wife, Ashlv, at his side.  The diminutive woman did not speak much; she dressed in a skirt and blouse of bright yellow, a headscarf covering all of her hair except the two white eyebrows, which she had curled down beside her cheeks. 

“Young miss,” Tozbek said, “you want to go swimming? Can’t you wait until we get into port? I know of some nice areas where the water is not nearly so cold. ”

“I won’t be swimming,” Shallan said, blushing further. 

### {Shallan} -> {Tozbek}
## 41. Sentence 741 of Words of Radiance: 

You were wise in bringing him to my attention. ”

Shallan smiled.  “You didn’t answer my question. ”

“You didn’t ask a question,” Jasnah said.  “These sketches are characteristically skillful, Shallan, but weren’t you supposed to be reading?”

“I… had trouble concentrating. ”

“So you came up on deck,” Jasnah said, “to sketch pictures of young men working without their shirts on.  You expected this to help your concentration?”

Shallan blushed, as Jasnah stopped at one sheet of paper in the stack. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 42. Sentence 1136 of Words of Radiance: 

She let them lower her farther until her legs were submerged in the frigid water.  Her skirt ballooned out in a most annoying way, and she actually had to step on the end of it—inside the loop—to prevent it from rising up about her waist and floating on the water’s surface as she submerged. 

She wrestled with the fabric for a moment, glad the men above couldn’t see her blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Sailors}
## 43. Sentence 1436 of Words of Radiance: 

“He’s property. ”

Kaladin opened his mouth to object, but the other bridgemen jumped in first. 

“He’s been freed, like us,” Teft said. 

“One of the team,” Hobber said.  “Give him the tattoo, or you won’t see a sphere from any of us. ” He blushed after he said it, glancing at Kaladin—who would be paying for all this, using spheres granted by Dalinar Kholin. 

### {Hobber} -> {Kaladin}
## 44. Sentence 1560 of Words of Radiance: 

Stiff blue trousers and black boots polished to a shine.  A buttoned white shirt, only the edges of its collar and cuffs extending beyond the jacket, which came down to the waist and buttoned closed beneath the belt. 

“Now, there’s a soldier!” the quartermaster said with a laugh.  “Still think you look silly?” He gestured for Moash to inspect his reflection in the mirror on the wall. 

Moash fixed his cuffs and actually blushed. 

### {Moash} -> {Kaladin}
## 45. Sentence 1835 of Words of Radiance: 

Cultivation, the god worshipped in the West, is a female deity that is an embodiment of nature and nature spren.  The various Voidspren, with their unseen lord—whose name changes depending on which culture we’re speaking of—evoke an enemy or antagonist.  The Stormfather, of course, is a strange offshoot of this, his theoretical nature changing depending on which era of Vorinism is doing the talking…”

She trailed off.  Shallan blushed, realizing she’d looked away and had begun tracing a glyphward on her blanket against the evil in Jasnah’s words. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 46. Sentence 3205 of Words of Radiance: 

Shallan pulled back, suddenly feeling as if she’d intruded upon an intimate moment.  Jasnah with her defenses down.  Shallan began to creep away, but a voice from the floor suddenly said, “Truth!”

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 47. Sentence 3322 of Words of Radiance: 

A way to find evidence that might convince everyone. ”

“Urithiru,” Shallan said.  “The city you seek?”

Jasnah gave her another curt glance.  The ancient city was something Shallan had first learned about by secretly reading Jasnah’s notes. 

“You still blush too easily when confronted,” Jasnah noted. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 48. Sentence 4532 of Words of Radiance: 

She felt around in her safepouch.  The other spheres were still there, but the the sleeve was unbuttoned.  Had she done that? Had they peeked? She couldn’t suppress a blush at the thought.

## 49. Sentence 5736 of Words of Radiance: 

Out here, though, she expected that swimmers were commonplace.  She had not expected them to be unclothed.

### {Rysn} -> {Nudist Reshi}
## 50. Sentence 5743 of Words of Radiance: 

Kylrm joined him.  “That’s another thing we don’t warn the newcomers about. ”

## 51. Sentence 6073 of Words of Radiance: 

‘Oh! Medicine! Of course we need medicine! Thank you for pointing that out.  I was just going to sit here and die. ’”

Rysn blushed. 

### {Rysn} -> {Talik}
## 52. Sentence 6176 of Words of Radiance:

## 53. Sentence 9210 of Words of Radiance: 

“Did my eyes mistake me? I saw a queen in the darkness.  Now I see a child. ”

## 54. Sentence 9819 of Words of Radiance:

## 55. Sentence 9996 of Words of Radiance: 

“Besides.  Brightness Shallan said our debts would be taken care of. ”

## 56. Sentence 10023 of Words of Radiance:

## 58. Sentence 11168 of Words of Radiance: 

Almost a worker’s shirt, though of nicer material. 

“Here,” Tyn said, tossing something to her.

### {Shallan} -> {Tyn}

“I will speak with my nephew.  Alone, please. ” Sometimes, working with scholars, you had to be a touch blunt.

## 71. Sentence 13674 of Words of Radiance: 

They started down the wide steps together.  “Aunt,” he said.  “Have you been, uh, doing anything to encourage my father’s advances? Between you two, I mean. ” For a boy who spent half his life flirting with anything in a dress, he certainly did blush a lot when he said that. 

### {Adolin} -> {Navani}
## 72. Sentence 14432 of Words of Radiance:

## 73. Sentence 14647 of Words of Radiance:

### {Shallan} -> {No-one}
## 77. Sentence 16039 of Words of Radiance:

## 81. Sentence 17261 of Words of Radiance: 

The few women that Shallan saw had the fingers cut out of the gloves on their safehands.  Scandalous.  She found herself blushing as she stopped at the perimeter, looking in at the dark, shifting forms.

## 83. Sentence 18422 of Words of Radiance: 

Long hair.  Blush on the cheeks.  I went and watched Sebarial bathe last night and—”

## 85. Sentence 18598 of Words of Radiance: 

.  No More Weakness





THREE YEARS AGO

“These are really good, Shallan,” Balat said, leafing through pages of her sketches.  The two of them sat in the gardens, accompanied by Wikim, who sat on the ground tossing a cloth-wrapped ball for his axehound Sakisa to catch. 

“My anatomy is off,” Shallan said with a blush. 

### {Shallan} -> {Balat}
## 86. Sentence 18609 of Words of Radiance: 

Father had once railed at him for that, claiming it was feminine and unseemly—but, in a rare show of dissension, Father’s ardents had approached him and told him to calm himself, and that the Almighty approved of Wikim’s interest.  They hoped Wikim might find his way into their ranks. 

“I heard that you got another letter from Eylita,” Shallan said, trying to distract Balat from the sketchbook.  She couldn’t keep herself from blushing as he turned page after page. 

### {Shallan} -> {Balat}
## 87. Sentence 18622 of Words of Radiance: 

“I wouldn’t have figured that for the Tavinar girl.  She seems too proper. ”

“No!” Balat blushed further. 

### {Balat} -> {Wikim}
## 88. Sentence 18631 of Words of Radiance: 

You are getting so touchy about that girl. ”

“Love makes us all fools,” Shallan said, distracting the two. 

“Love?” Balat asked, glancing at her.  “Shallan, you’re barely old enough to pin up your safehand.  What do you know about love?”

She blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Balat}
## 89. Sentence 18675 of Words of Radiance: 

Wikim, however, was rolling on the ground.  After a moment, Balat shook his head, and gave an agreeable chuckle.  For her own part, Shallan was blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Balat}
## 90. Sentence 18679 of Words of Radiance: 

It had also been improper. 

She got a guilty thrill from it.  Balat looked embarrassed, and he blushed at the double meaning, collecting shamespren. 

### {Balat} -> {Shallan}
## 91. Sentence 18865 of Words of Radiance: 

“But he may not.  It is a gamble, and you do not strike me as the kind of man who gambles. ”

The man laughed.  “What makes you say that? Gambling is what brought me here!”

“No,” she said, blushing at her tears. 

### {Shallan} -> {Taravangian's bastard}
## 92. Wrong context. 
## 93. Sentence 19002 of Words of Radiance: 

Adolin seemed perfectly at ease both with his station and those around him.  When he waved for the master-servant to bring him a list of wines, he smiled at the woman, though she was darkeyed.  That smile was enough to produce a blush even in a master-servant. 

### {Master-servant} -> {Adolin}
## 94. Sentence 19117 of Words of Radiance: 

“You’re out there on the battlefield, encased in metal like a crab in its shell.  What do you do if nature calls?”

“I… er…” Adolin frowned at her.  “That is not something any woman has ever asked me before. ”

“Yay for originality!” Shallan said, though she blushed as she said it. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 95. Wrong context. 
## 96. Sentence 19245 of Words of Radiance: 

“The gemhearts we get feed the people of the warcamps.  Without a constant flow of new stones of reasonable size, the Soulcasters will eventually crack the ones we have, and we won’t be able to support the armies here. ”

“I’m not telling you to stop your hunts,” Shallan said, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 97. Sentence 19334 of Words of Radiance: 

“I’ve left you upset.  I’m not very good at this wooing thing. ”

“Could have fooled me…” Adolin said, resting his hand on her arm. 

Shallan covered another blush by ducking her head and digging into her satchel. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 98. Sentence 19460 of Words of Radiance: 

We could have spent that much longer out there. ”

Adolin regarded her with an incredulous expression.  “When you first realized what we were doing on that balcony, you seemed terrified. ”

“I was. ”

“Now you wish you’d stayed out until the last moment before the storm hit?”

“I… yeah,” she said, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 99. Sentence 21017 of Words of Radiance: 

Against the Alethi. 

Mraize was studying her—watching her with unreadable eyes, long blowgun held lightly in his fingertips.  “I see,” he finally said, “Tyn chose a scholar to be her apprentice this time around? I find that unusual. ”

Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Mraize}
## 100. Sentence 21127 of Words of Radiance: 

There should be ways to use this, yes indeed. ” He looked to her.  “What is your goal, child? I might have a place for you in my organization, if you prove reliable. ”

Yes! “I wouldn’t have agreed to come in Tyn’s place if I hadn’t wanted that opportunity. ”

Mraize narrowed his eyes at Shallan.  “You killed her, didn’t you?”

Oh, blast.  Shallan blushed immediately, of course. 

### {Shallan} -> {Mraize}
## 101. Sentence 21502 of Words of Radiance: 

Finally, Shallan released Wit and looked at the prince. 

“You hugged Wit,” Adolin said. 

“Is that his name?” Shallan asked. 

“One of them,” Wit said, apparently still unsettled.  “There are too many to count, really.  Granted, most of them are related to one form of curse or another…”

“You hugged Wit,” Adolin said. 

Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 102. Sentence 21589 of Words of Radiance: 

What was it?

Adolin turned back around and asked after her day.  Kaladin listened with half an ear, studying Shallan, trying to pick out any knives hidden on her person.  She blushed at something Adolin said, then laughed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 103. Wrong context. 
## 104. Sentence 21701 of Words of Radiance: 

This is brilliant.  Thank you. ”

She blushed, then packed away the notes in an envelope and handed it to him. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 105. Sentence 23323 of Words of Radiance: 

That’s where the viziers and everyone important will be reviewing applications.  In the Prime’s presence. ”

“But he’s dead. ”

“The new Prime. ”

“He ain’t been chosen yet!”

“Well, it’s kind of strange,” Gawx said.  By the dim light of the cracked door, she could see him blushing, as if he knew how starvin’ odd this all was. 

### {Gawx} -> {Lift}
## 106. Sentence 28002 of Words of Radiance: 

He looked back at her, holding up a sphere.  “You aren’t going to demand I give you my boots again, are you?”

She raised a foot, revealing the military-style boots she wore underneath her dress.  That got him to cock an eyebrow. 

“I wasn’t about to come out onto the Shattered Plains in slippers,” she said, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kaladin}
## 107. Sentence 28710 of Words of Radiance: 

Uniforms on, spears polished. ”

“We wait on our own time, sir,” Teft said.  “Neither of us three are supposed to be anywhere else. ” He blushed as soon as he said it. 

### {Teft} -> {Kaladin}
## 108. Sentence 28870 of Words of Radiance: 

A weapon… Vibrations? Like sand on a plate? An earthquake that could break rock… Stone became sand, and at the blowing of the highstorms, the cracks full of sand were hollowed out. ”

Her eyes seemed eerily distant, and Kaladin didn’t understand half of what she’d said. 

“We need to reach the center,” Shallan said.  “I can find it, the heart of these Plains, by following the pattern.  And there will be… things there…”

“The secret you’re searching for,” Kaladin said.  What had she said just earlier? “Oathgate?”

She blushed deeply. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kaladin}
## 109. Sentence 30369 of Words of Radiance: 

“He held her at this point, and whispered some things I did not hear.  From there, they got very close and made some interesting noises.  I can reproduce—”

## 110. Sentence 30691 of Words of Radiance: 

“For the past five years, I have eaten only a bowl of boiled tallew for each meal, with a piece of fruit on special occasions.  This will not tempt me. ”

She nodded. 

“What is wrong with you?”

She blushed. 

### {Pai} -> {Lhan}
## 111. Sentence 31976 of Words of Radiance: 

Like the wind and rocks were. 

Shallan completely missed what Adolin said next.  She blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 112. Sentence 32097 of Words of Radiance: 

Navani leafed through them, reading by spherelight.  “The organization of these notes is… interesting. ”

## 113. Sentence 32176 of Words of Radiance: 

I do not expect there to be anything dangerous on the other side, but he’ll undoubtedly want to send soldiers through first. ”

Navani raised an eyebrow at her.  “You’ve done a touch of thinking about this, I see. ”

Shallan nodded, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Navani}
## 114. Sentence 32367 of Words of Radiance: 

Stormseat.  How did you do it?”

“I didn’t.  Brightness Navani did. ”

“I…” Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Dalinar}
## 115. Sentence 32470 of Words of Radiance: 

Sir, please don’t tell anyone about this.  For now, at least. ”

“This was why Jasnah took you on as a ward,” Dalinar said.  “It’s why she wanted you marrying Adolin, isn’t it? To bind you to us?”

“Yes,” Shallan said, blushing in the darkness. 

### {Shallan} -> {Dalinar}
## 116. Sentence 32836 of Words of Radiance: 

Even with them having the terrain advantage, even if we have to assault rather than defend, we should handle that many with ease.  We have over thirty thousand. ”

“This is what we came to do,” Dalinar said.  He looked at Shallan, who blushed at her forwardness earlier. 

### {Shallan} -> {Dalinar}
## 117. Sentence 35898 of Words of Radiance: 

One of the soldiers nearby cleared his throat.  “You certain you should be that close to the edge, Brightness Radiant?”

She gave the man a droll look.  “I could survive that drop and stroll away, soldier. ”

“Um, yes, Brightness,” he said, blushing. 

### {Soldier} -> {Shallan}
## 118. Sentence 36200 of Words of Radiance: 

“Shallan.  You’re something greater than even a lighteyes. ”

“Was that a wisecrack about my girth?”

## 119. Wrong use of word. 
## 120. Sentence 2774 of Oathbringer: 

Renarin was standing right behind her.  She jumped, letting out a pathetic squeak.  Then she blushed furiously; she’d forgotten he was even with them. 

### {Shallan} -> {Renarin}
## 121. Sentence 2972 of Oathbringer: 

Sot raised the alarm, and that chased the creatures off.  They only left four sacks, which we moved. ”

### {Ardent} -> {Kaladin}
## 122. Sentence 3140 of Oathbringer: 

“He’s excited. ”

“He likes an audience. ”

“They don’t fit, you know. ”

“Don’t fit?”

“Ryshadium have stone hooves,” Renarin said, “stronger than ordinary horses’.  Never need to be shod. ”

“And that makes them not fit? I’d say that makes them fit better. …” Adolin eyed Renarin.  “You mean ordinary horses, don’t you?”

Renarin blushed, then nodded. 

### {Renarin} -> {Adolin}
## 123. Sentence 3165 of Oathbringer: 

Renarin glanced away. 

“Or not,” Adolin said, then poked Renarin in the shoulder.  “You’ve got a replacement already, don’t you. ”

Renarin blushed again. 

### {Renarin} -> {Adolin}
## 124. Wrong context. 
## 125. Sentence 4264 of Oathbringer: 

Adolin didn’t even have the decency to blush at finding her practically naked.  He balanced the food in his hand, recovering from his stumble, and then grinned. 

“Out!” Shallan said, waving her freehand at him.  “Out, out, out!”

He backed away awkwardly, through the draped cloth over the doorway.  Stormfather! Shallan’s blush was probably so bright they could have used her as a signal to send the army to war. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 126. Sentence 4325 of Oathbringer: 

“No chairs yet. ”

“I just realized,” he said, “this is your bedroom. ”

“And my drawing room, and my sitting room, and my dining room, and my ‘Adolin says obvious things’ room.  It’s quite versatile, this room—singular—of mine.  Why?”

“I’m just wondering if it’s proper,” he said, then actually blushed—which was adorable. 

### {Adolin} -> {Shallan}
## 127. Sentence 6503 of Oathbringer: 

“You impressed him. ” She cocked her head.  “Are you wet?”

### {Dalinar} -> {Navani}
## 128. Sentence 7159 of Oathbringer: 

It depends upon the angle from which you view it.  You will see, as you work with us, that I am right. ”

“I’m not one of you,” Shallan hissed. 

“For one so insistent,” Mraize said, picking up a chair, “you were certainly free in using our symbol last night. ”

Shallan froze, then blushed furiously. 

### {Shallan} -> {Mraize}
## 129. Sentence 8782 of Oathbringer: 

She burst in on Vathah and his team, who sat inside playing cards by the light of a few spheres.  Poor Gaz sat on the chamber pot in a corner privy, and he yelped, pulling closed the cloth on the doorway. 

Guess I should have anticipated that, Shallan thought, covering her blush by sucking in a burst of Stormlight. 

### {Shallan} -> {Vathah}
## 130. Sentence 11439 of Oathbringer: 

People will be curious, and a written account will save me from having to explain it all the time. ”

“Oh,” Lyn said.  “A scribe. ”

“Of course,” Kaladin said, turning back toward her in the hallway, frowning.  “You’re a woman, aren’t you?”

“I thought you were asking … I mean, in the highprince’s visions, there were women who were Knights Radiant, and with Brightness Shallan…” She blushed. 

### {Lyn} -> {Kaladin}
## 131. Sentence 11995 of Oathbringer: 

Truthwatcher! Is good name.  More people should watch truth, instead of lies. ”

Renarin blushed. 

### {Renarin} -> {Lunamor}
## 132. Sentence 13116 of Oathbringer: 

Actually, it was a bit more complex than a doodle.  It was … kind of a full sketch of Kaladin’s face, with passionate eyes and a determined expression.  Jasnah had noticed a creationspren in the form of a small gemstone that had appeared on the top of her page, and Shallan blushed, shooing it away. 

### {Shallan} -> {Jasnah}
## 133. Sentence 13222 of Oathbringer: 

At the very least, she created far fewer for herself than Shallan did. 

It was about this point that Shallan realized she’d missed a good fifteen minutes of the meeting, and had again lapsed in her note-taking.  Blushing furiously, she huddled up on her chair and did her best to remain focused for the rest of the meeting. 

### {Jasnah} -> {Shallan}
## 134. Sentence 13468 of Oathbringer: 

Red hastily pulled up another chair. 

Ishnah settled herself, holding the wig to her chest.  She blushed deeply, but maintained some measure of poise, meeting the eyes of Vathah and his men. 

### {Ishanh} -> {Shallan}
## 135. Sentence 13501 of Oathbringer: 

“Next time, rough up your freehand some more.  The fingers gave you away; they aren’t the fingers of a laborer. ”

### {Ishnah} -> {Shallan}
## 136. Sentence 14366 of Oathbringer: 

The prince … well, he often incited such reactions.  Discomforted stares. 

“Brightlord?” Janala asked.  “Are you perhaps secretly an artifabrian? Studying engineering by night, reading the women’s script?”

Several of the others chuckled.  Renarin blushed deeply, lowering his eyes farther. 

### {Renarin} -> {Janala}
## 137. Sentence 14464 of Oathbringer: 

That made a lot of sense.  Dalinar would need his Radiants to go do things, right? She needed to get away, just until she could figure things out.  Go somewhere … like on that mission to Kholinar? Wouldn’t they need someone who could sneak into the palace and activate the device?

“Renarin,” she said, “you’re a genius. ”

He blushed, but smiled. 

### {Renarin} -> {Shallan}
## 138. Sentence 19871 of Oathbringer: 

Her safehand bulged out from between the sleeve buttons, poking into the open right in front of not just the king, but Kaladin and Adolin. 

Perfectly, horribly, incredibly mortifying.  She felt a deep blush come on, and shamespren dropped around her in a wave. 

### {Shallan} -> {Court}
## 139. Sentence 19875 of Oathbringer: 

These were like pieces of broken glass. 

The men, of course, were more distracted by the position she’d gotten herself into.  She squawked, managed to take a Memory of the shamespren, and righted herself, blushing furiously and tucking her hand in her sleeve. 

### {Shallan} -> {Court}
## 140. Sentence 21627 of Oathbringer: 

“The persona … fled once you recognized me. ”

“Shame about the dark hair.  Your natural red would be arresting with the white coat. ”

“This guise is supposed to be less memorable than that. ”

He glanced at the hat, which she’d set on the table.  Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Wit}
## 141. Sentence 24360 of Oathbringer: 

“Oh, Adolin Kholin.  You are your father’s son.  I won’t do it again, all right?”

He was blushing. 

### {Adolin} -> {Shallan}
## 142. Sentence 24375 of Oathbringer: 

A young woman, lighteyed and hanging out a window, hair drifting free, wearing only a nightgown with her hand tied in a pouch. 

“Shallan,” he said, “these are amazing! Some of the best work you’ve ever done. ”

“They’re just quick sketches, Adolin. ”

“They’re beautiful,” he said, looking at another, where he stopped.  It was a picture of him in one of his new suits. 

Shallan blushed. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 143. Sentence 27296 of Oathbringer: 

“You’re in uniform, soldier.  Your tone is too familiar.  Is this how I taught you to act?”

### {Adolin} -> {Dalinar}
## 144. Sentence 30514 of Oathbringer: 

It’s about doing what is demanded of you, in serving the greater good.  You can’t just abandon responsibility because you feel like it. ”

Azure glanced at Adolin, and he felt himself blush. 

### {Adolin} -> {Azure}
## 145. Sentence 31408 of Oathbringer: 

The room buzzed with a low hum of discussion and scratching reeds, concentrationspren dotting the air like ripples in the sky. 

Jasnah strolled along the tables, looking through pages of translations.  As Navani entered, the bridgemen gathered around Renarin, who blushed, looking up from his own papers, which were covered in glyphs and numbers. 

### {Renarin} -> {Bridgemen}
## 146. Sentence 32663 of Oathbringer: 

Because she was afraid.  Could she invent someone who wasn’t afraid? Someone new, since Veil was broken, and had been since that failure in the Kholinar market …

“Shallan?” Adolin asked, coming over to her.  “Are you all right?”

She shook herself.  How long had she been sitting there? “I’m fine,” she said.  “Just … remembering. ”

“Good things or bad?”

“All memories are bad,” she said immediately, then looked away, blushing. 

### {Shallan} -> {Adolin}
## 147. Sentence 32916 of Oathbringer: 

The way her posture shifted. 

And the way that she seemed to melt upon seeing Kaladin, lips rising to a grin.  Blushing, she adopted a fond—even eager—expression. 

### {Shallan} -> {Kaladin}
## 148. Sentence 34404 of Oathbringer: 

She hovered down toward the queen’s guardsman—eyeing the spheres on his belt—but Rysn snatched her from the air. 

Chiri-Chiri griped, buzzing her wings against Rysn’s hand and clicking.  Rysn blushed, but held tight. 

### {Rysn} -> {Guardsmen}
## 149. Sentence 38781 of Oathbringer: 

She pulled herself to her feet as Kaladin strode along the wall to meet with Dalinar.  What happened to his boots?

“Shallan?” Adolin asked. 

“A palanquin sounds great,” Veil said.  “Thanks. ”

Adolin blushed, then nodded and strode toward one of the stairwells down into the city. 

### {Adolin} -> {Shallan}
